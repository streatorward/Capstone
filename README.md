## What is Slackerz?

> Slackerz is a simple and easy to use ToDo app that will help you to keep track of your daily, weekly, and monthly tasks of your busy schedule. I designed this app since I work a full time job in addition to being a full time student and having a few hobbies. This App lets me keep track of everything I have going on and makes sure to keep me on track.
